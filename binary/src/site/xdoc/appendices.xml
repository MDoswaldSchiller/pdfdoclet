<section name="Appendices">
	<subsection name="Introduction">
<p><p></p>It is possible to include additional HTML or PDF pages as appendices in the generated
    PDF document. Each appendix can be given a custom name / number and a label. The files
    that should be used as appendices must be in the "doc-files" subdirectory, just as any
    additional files referenced in a javadoc page have to.</p>
   </subsection>
   
   <subsection name="Appendix Configuration">
	<p><p></p>To define an appendix, a set of properties must be defined. These
	properties are grouped together (for each appendix) by a number in the name
	of the property. 
	</p>
	<p><p></p>
	Here are two examples. The first shows how to include an external
	HTML file in an appendix:
	<pre>
       appendix.1.name=A
       appendix.1.title=Some Stuff
       appendix.1.file=./doc-files/some-other-file.html
	</pre>
	The HTML file will be included in an appendix before the index pages.
	</p>
	<p><p></p>
	The next example shows how to include pages of an external PDF document. If no page
	numbers are specified, only the first page will be imported.
	<pre>
       appendix.2.name=B
       appendix.2.title=Project Info
       appendix.2.file=./doc-files/projectinfo.pdf,3-5
	</pre>
	This example imports pages 3-5 from the file "projectinfo.pdf". Page numbers can be
	specified as a list of comma-separated entries, either single values or ranges. Here
	are a few examples:
	<pre>
       appendix.2.file=./doc-files/projectinfo.pdf,1,4-8,20,25
       appendix.2.file=./doc-files/projectinfo.pdf,1,3,5-7
	</pre>
	</p>
   </subsection>
   
   <subsection name="Links To Appendices">
	<p><p></p>To create a link to an appendix file (which works, of course, both in the
	HTML javadoc as well as in the PDF file) use a link like this:
	<pre>
	    &lt;a href="./doc-files/some-other-file.html"&gt;link to an appendix file.&lt;/a&gt;
	</pre>
	This also works for PDF files (but it's not possible to link to a certain 
	page, if more than one page has been imported).
