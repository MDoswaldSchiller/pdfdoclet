This is the project tarball. It is intended for people who 
want to work on the doclet, take a look into the sourcecode 
etc. However, if someone really intends to contribute code, 
the preferred way is to get a SourceForge account and work 
with the CVS directly (contact the project admin to get 
permission for CVS commits).

Of course this package also allows to just use the doclet. 
But anyone who just wants to use the doclet to create 
javadoc (without having to compile it first) should 
download the smaller, ready-to-run "binary" package.
