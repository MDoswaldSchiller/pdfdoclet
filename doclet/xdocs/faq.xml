	If you happen to find a bug in PDFDoclet, it's likely to be some
	javadoc-feature that has not been implemented correctly or
	not at all in PDFDoclet. In that case, see if you can reproduce
	the problem, and if you can nail it down to a certain part of
	your Java sourcecodes. Then submit a bug entry in the
	SourceForge project bug tracking database:
	</p>
	<p><p></p>
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=55507&amp;atid=477255">https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=55507&amp;atid=477255</a>
	</p>
	<p><p></p>
	Describe your findings as detailled as possible, and attach
	any files that may be useful in fixing the bug (the logfile,
	your source files etc.).

    <subsection name="My HTML-tags are not handled correctly (or at all). Why?">
            <solution name="number_1" text="My HTML-tags are not handled correctly (or at all). Why?">
        <a name="question1" /><p><p></p>
    Some HTML tags are simply not supported at all (yet),
    as it is quite complicated to create appropriate PDF objects
    for certain complicated HTML code. This might be implemented
    in future versions. If this is really a must-have for your project,
	check out other PDF-generating doclets (see the links page
	on the PDFDoclet website).

    <subsection name="How do I use the doclet in a shell script?">
        <solution name="number_2" text="How do I use the doclet in a shell script?">
        <a name="question2" /><p><p></p>
    Check out the "binaries" package. It contains examples for
    using the doclet both with shell scripts or with ANT.

    <subsection name="My image files are not found (for the image tag).">
        <solution name="number_3" text="My image files are not found (for the image tag).">
        <a name="question3" /><p><p></p>
    Use the "-workdir" configuration parameter (or the "workdir"
    configuration property in the config file). Use it to set the start
    path of the doclet for looking for external files to the path
    relative to which your image can be found, as you specified
    it in the "&lt;img&gt;" tag. Take a look at the example "test-pdf"
    in the "example/src3" directory.

    If the working directory is not specified, it's just ".".

    Please note that the tag {@docRoot} at the beginning of a file
    path specification will just be replaced with the value of the
    working directory.

    <subsection name="The blank space character between two tags gets lost">
        <solution name="number_4" text="The blank space character between to tags gets lost">
        <a name="question4"/><p><p></p>
    This problem has been solved with release 0.8.1 of PDFDoclet. 
    The reason for this problem has been an incorrect use of JTidy in
    previous releases. Please update to 0.8.1 or newer.

    <subsection name="How do I print or disable custom tags?">
        <solution name="number_5" text="How do I print or disable custom tags?">
        <a name="question5" /><p><p></p>
    Custom tags are not printed as long as there is no label defined for 
	them. See the "Configuration" page or the test.pdf example for how 
	to specify a label for a custom tag. So, disabling a custom tag can be 
	done by simply not specifying a label for it.

    <subsection name="I get Runtime exceptions '..has no valid destination'">
        <solution name="number_6" text="I get Runtime exceptions '..has no valid destination'">
        <a name="question6" /><p><p></p>
        This problem was solved with release 0.9.2, so just update to a current release.
        A little explanation here: The message means that somewhere in the javadoc is
        a reference to a target that does not exist (at least not in the exact form
        of that reference). Like a "@see AnyClass#someMethod(String)", where the older
        PDFDoclet version could not correctly resolve certain anchor formats (with
        or without parameters etc.).

        <solution name="number_7" text="My embedded font creates some strange characters.">
        <a name="question7" /><p><p></p>
        The problem lies in finding the correct encoding setting for the font.
        For Windows-based fonts, try "Cp1252".
