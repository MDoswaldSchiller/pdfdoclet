    <release version="1.0.2" date="10-12-2005" description="Bugfix release.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1327157">Custom tag names
		are now handled case-sensitive (as they should be!).
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1313937">Multiple inheritance
		of interfaces was not handled correctly. The "extends ..." text contained
		only one of the inherited interfaces.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1375788">The doclet generated
		a 0-length PDF file, if an invalid font was specified. An appropriate error
		message was printed for the missing font, but then the doclet continued and
		failed later with a NullPointerException, leaving a corrupt file behind. Now
		the doclet cancels processing if a font path is invalid and deletes the
		PDF file.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1293618">Field and methods 
		within a class bookmark entry are now sorted alphabetically.
		</action>
	</release>

    <release version="1.0.1" date="11-09-2005" description="Bugfix release.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add" issue="1256563">Added support for more HTML tags: STRONG and 
		Definition lists (DL / DT / DD).
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update" issue="1256562">Made PRE (sections of 
		preformatted code) nicer and better distinguishable from the rest of the page,
		by putting them into a box with a black border and light-gray background color.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for specifying several files 
		from which to import pages into the overview, using numbered property names, such
		as "overview.pdf.file.1", "overview.pdf.file.2" etc.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1256571">The spacing before some
		Hx-tags (like H1, H2..) was smaller than the spacing after the tag. This lead to
		the impression that the heading belonged to the previous parapgraph instead of
		the next.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1256540">
		 Font path names were not used relative to the specified "workdir" property
		 value.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1256542">Classes within a package
		 in the bookmarks were not sorted alphabetically.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1283004">The CENTER tag did not
		work anymore. The reason was a JTidy setting which caused CENTER tags to be
		replaced with DIV tags.
		</action>
	</release>
    
    <release version="1.0.0" date="03-07-2005" description="First stable production release.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for importing pages from PDF files
		in appendices, before the overview and for the title page.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for including custom HTML files
		as appendices before the index.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Massively improved bookmarking code in order to
		support the "-group" parameter and allow for a more detailled bookmark tree per class
		entry (links to constructors, fields and methods).
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for anchors (&lt;a name="..." &gt;)
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for custom bookmark entries, using
		  special anchors (&lt;a name="pdfbookmark" label="...." &gt;). This is especially useful
		  if an overview is used which spans several printed pages. Together with the HTML 
		  comment used to trigger page breaks, this feature helps to improve the structure
		  and usability of the generated PDF.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Configuration switch "inherited.summary.table" added for 
			enabling / disabling printing of summary tables for inherited methods and fields. The
			property also allows to print only summary tables for elements inherited within the
			scope of the API, but not of methods, fields etc. inherited from standard classes
			such as "<code>java.lang.Object</code>".
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Bulleted lists are now displayed with an actual
			bullet symbol instead of a dash character.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Added some leading space for regions of PREformatted
			text, just as in HTML pages.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">Handling of "author", "version" and "since" parameters /
			properties didn't work correctly anymore. This has been fixed, so that printing of those tags
			can be suppressed again.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Minor layout / spacing improvements.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added parameters for overriding labels of bookmark 
		entries for fields, constructor and methods outlines.
		</action>
	</release>
	
    <release version="0.9.2" date="04-06-2005" description="Hardcoded test-output removed from overview.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Unfortunatly, some hard-coded test-output I had inserted
			into the overview had not been removed. I only realized that after I had just release 0.9.1,
			so I had to remove that release immediately and put this fixed version online.
		</action>
	</release>
	
    <release version="0.9.1" date="04-06-2005" description="HTML table support implemented.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Implemented support for HTML tables.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for list types in ordered lists (roman etc.).
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">Bulleted lists are now printed correctly in method 
			docs again (and so are tables).
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Updated to iText 1.3.
         </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Got rid of ORO package because no regexp processing
			is done by the PDFDoclet anymore. Those methods have been replaced by similar functionality
			of Sun's base doclet API itself.
         </action>
	</release>
	
    <release version="0.9.0" date="18-04-2005" description="New features and bug fixes implemented.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for custom filtering. It is now
		possible to create PDF output only for certain classes / methods / members, based on custom
		tags. See the "Usage" page of the HTML documentation for details. The main reason for this
		feature is to allow to create extracts of an API based, for example, on project or developer
		names etc.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added support for printing any custom tags (such
		as "@todo"). A custom tag like "@todo" will be ignored, though, as long as there is no label
		defined for it in the configuration. A label definition for a custom "todo" tag could be:
		labels.tag.todo=To Do:
         </action>
		 <action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1183868">"workdir" was processed as a configuration
		property only, but not as a commandline argument.
		</action>
		 <action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1186422">A-tags (links) without a "href" field
			caused a NullPointerException in the TagA class.
		</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">Added printing of fields and methods inherited from
		any interface in the "... inherited" tables.
         </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Cleaned up the "test-pdf" example sources.
         </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Added note about custom tag to FAQ.
         </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Some refactoring (extracted some large methods
		from the main class "PDFDoclet" which has now, at long 
		last, achieved a reasonable size.
         </action>
	</release>
	
    <release version="0.8.2" date="06-03-2005" description="Bugfix release.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1156553">Resolving the "inheritDoc"-inline-tag was implemented in
	a way which could not deal with recursive inheritance over
	several levels of classes (subsubclass inherits doc from 
	subclass which inherits doc from subclass etc.). The fix
	implements a proper, recursive resolution. The test-pdf
	example has been exteded to test this (classes OtherClass,
	SubClass and TestClass).
        </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Included Log4j for debug/info logging. If it is called with 
	the "-debug" flag, it prints plenty of debug output to the
	logfile "pdfdoclet.log" and some info log to the console.
         </action>
	</release>
	
    <release version="0.8.1" date="09-02-2005" description="Bugfix release.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="849061">The annoying missing-blanks-problem has finally gone away.
    The secret lied in using JTidy differently (and maybe also
	in using a more current version of JTidy). I won't go in much
	detail here, but I'll just say that it should no longer be 
	necessary to encode blanks or insert them before an
	ending tag just to get them out in the PDF.
    </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="1058391">ClassCastException caused by open list tags has been
    solved by the fact that JTidy now actually tidies up the HTML.</action>
	<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">Implemented better error handling for IOException which occurs
	if the PDF file cannot be opened for writing.</action>
	<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">Shut up JTidy. This was necessary because currently i'm using a
	snapshot release of JTidy which creates lots of debug output.</action>
	</release>

    <release version="0.8.0" date="14-01-2005" description="Project resurrection after a year of silence.">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Java 1.4 is now required. This is due to the fact that
    PDFDoclet now uses some methods of the doclet API 
    available only from 1.4 on. Sorry, if that's a problem to
    anyone. However, I think that nowadays Java 1.4 should be
    available on almost any platform.
    If not, maybe it's possible to run it with Java 1.2/1.3
    and just include the "tools.jar" from 1.4 in the classpath.
    I've no idea if that's possible, just an idea that came to
    my mind. You may try that if you're really desperate... </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Switched to Maven as the build tool.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="update">Included the most current snapshot release of JTidy.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Implemented creation of single Jar file which contains
			all dependencies to make javadoc execution easier.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Constant values are now printed in field summaries.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Implemented printing of inherited methods and fields in 
    summary of interfaces (which extend another interface).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add" issue="913036">Support for {@inheritDoc} inline tag
    Implemented for both method doc blocks and tags</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">New "font.." parameters (see README) allow to use other fonts
    by embedding TrueType fonts (ttf).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">NullPointerException fixed which occurred if an image tag
    had no "src" attribute (for example due to a typo, like "srx=")</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="972464">Overview pages had no header and footer and therefore no 
    page numbering. This has been fixed.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894692">Until now, in method signatures, only for the return type
    a link was created, but not for the parameters. Now, the
    parameters are links too (depending on their type, of course).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="931060">Implemented correct support for @see tags and inline links
    like {@link ..}, inluding correct linking to the actual
    member (method, variable), not just the containing class.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894560">Change the boomark entry of the title
    In the outline frame (the bookmarks), the labels were somewhat
    inconsistent ("Title Page", but "Overview" and "Index", not 
    "Overview Page" etc.). The defaults are now consistent (without
    "page"). The labels can also be customized with 3 new 
    configuration properties: "label.bookmarks.index", "label.bookmarks.title" and "label.bookmarks.overview"</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894449">Changed IConstants.LB_EXCEP_TAG value to "Throws:". 
    The label "Exceptions:" was replaced by "Throws:"</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894506">Allow all options to be set in the config file or as 			params. 
    All configuration values may now be specified either in a property
    file or as commandline arguments. There is a new section in the
    README file which explains all configuration properties.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894488,894544,894478">Several still hard-coded parameter names or values replaced</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894562">Add an 'Overview' entry into the bookmarks
    The "overview.html" page now also has its own entry in the 
    bookmarks, just behind the "Title Page" entry.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="895216">
    When the first sentence contained package names like "java.util...",
    only the part of the text up to the first dot "." was taken as the
    first sentence (used in the summary tables).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="895261">NullPointerException for unvalued attribute
    HTML-tag attributes without values, such as NOWRAP in a TABLE,
    created a NullPointerException. This has been fixed.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894673">Parameters in bookmarks stopping after the first one
    Methods in bookmarks now contain all parameters, but only their
    types (to keep the bookmarks short), like this:
    doSomething(String,Properties)</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="895226">Error messages need some context info
    In debug mode, the member (method, variable..) currently 
    being processed is now also printed. This makes it easier to
    locate HTML problems mentioned by JTidy warnings.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="894708">
    Some mixed case text has been fixed for better consistency.</action>
	</release>

    <release version="0.7.0" date="17-01-2004">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Made index more compact by printing all page numbers
    of members (methods, classes, fields) with same name 
    on the same line (like: doSomething 23, 35, 88).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added link to title page in outline (navigation frame).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="848194">Implemented handling of &quot;doc-files&quot; subdirectory.
    </action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">Fixed problem with doclet hanging if a file (usually
    an image) was not found due to an invalid path.
    Now the doclet just ignores the image in those cases
    and completes the rest of the javadoc.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="845938">Fixed problem of parameter names and their descriptions
    not being on the same line.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix" issue="848304">Fixed &quot;dontspec&quot;-config problem with field summaries.

    <release version="0.6.0" date="06-11-2005">
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added option for custom order of packages in the 
    bookmarks frame (new parameter &quot;sort&quot;, as commandline
    argument or as configuration parameter - see the 
    &quot;config_test.properties&quot; file for an example).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add" issue="800912">Added support for the {@docRoot} tag introduced in 
    JDK 1.3. It's now being replaced with the working 
    directory value, which is just &quot;.&quot; if unspecified.</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add">Added option for specifying packages whose classes 
    should not be fully qualified (new parameter &quot;dontspec&quot; 
    as commandline argument or as configuration property).
    Example: By setting &quot;dontspec=java.lang&quot;, a String method
    parameter will be printed just as &quot;String&quot; and not as
    &quot;java.lang.String&quot;.
    Until now, only the packages for which the javadoc 
    was printed were not fully qualified (which is the
    default behaviour of the regular javadoc).</action>
		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="add" issue="821282">Added correct handling of inner classes. They are now
    connected to their containing class in the bookmarks
    navigation frame.</action>

    arguments in method summary.</action>

		<action dev="marcelschoen" type="fix">Also fixed the &quot;broken&quot; binary package of 0.5.1 (version number 
of JAR file was invalid in build.xml and shell script). This 
will not happen again as I've changed the build target which 
builds the binary package. It uses an ANT filter now to make 
sure the version number is always up-to-date.</action>
