1. Introduction
---------------
This is a javadoc doclet which produces PDF output for a given 
Java API, using another opensource library, "iText" (see 7). It 
requires nothing more than two JAR files (its own one and 
the one from iText) in order to create PDF files. Forget now  
about all the fuss of having to create MIF output first, then 
having to load it into a FrameMaker installation using some preinstalled 
batch application and finally needing Acrobat Distiller to create 
a PDF...

PDFDoclet is a straightforward, simple-to-use 100% pure Java solution. 
Kudos to the authors of iText for making it possible!

/target/example ..... (created) Contains created sample PDF files


3. Prerequisites
----------------
PDFDoclet has been designed using J2SE 1.4, so it will eventually 
not work with the older javadoc version. However, since the new 
javadoc produces much better output anyway, I'd recommend to 
use it even for Java 1.1.x targeted projects.
As it has not been tested with older Java versions, feel free 
to do so. Feedback is greatly appreciated.


4. Installation
---------------
You need the following things to build PDFDoclet:

- JDK (J2SE)
- Maven 1.0

It is assumed that you know how to use Maven. If not, 
get it from the Jakarta homepage (http://ant.apache.org) 
and install it.

Run the Maven goal "example" to build everything and create 
all sample PDF files.


5. Eclipse Project Setup
------------------------
The PDFDoclet CVS module also contains Eclipse project 
files. In order to be able to compile everything, two
classpath variables must be created, one under "Window / 
Preferences / Java / Build Path / Classpath Variables":

  TOOL_LIB_1_4 
  
must point to the "tools.jar" file of a J2SE 1.4 JDK.
And second, a JRE must be registered under "Window / 
Preferences / Java / Installed JREs":

  JDK_1_4
  
must point to the root directory of a JDK 1.4.


6. Usage
--------
Check out the example goals in the "maven.xml" or, 
even better, the binary package. The binary package 
has both examples for how to use the doclet from ANT 
or from shell scripts.


7. Anonymous CVS Access
-----------------------

This project's SourceForge CVS repository can be checked 
out through anonymous (pserver) CVS with the following 
instruction set. The module you wish to check out must be 
specified as the modulename. When prompted for a password 
for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pdfdoclet.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pdfdoclet login
 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.pdfdoclet.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pdfdoclet co modulename

Updates from within the module's directory do not need 
the -d parameter.
