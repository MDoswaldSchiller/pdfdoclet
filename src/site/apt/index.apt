Welcome to the PDFDoclet

 This Javadoc doclet allows to create a PDF file for a Java API documentation
 instead of the standard HTML files.

 The project is split into different modules, one is the actual doclet module,
 one contains all 3rd party libraries (dependencies) used by PDFDoclet, and the
 others are for examples and packages.
